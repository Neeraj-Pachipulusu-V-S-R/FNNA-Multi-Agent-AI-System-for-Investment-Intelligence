## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The financial markets generate vast amounts of unstructured textual data daily through news articles, earnings reports, regulatory filings, and market commentary. Traditional financial analysis methods struggle to process this information at scale while maintaining accuracy and timeliness. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for automated financial intelligence systems.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Financial analysts face several critical challenges:
- **Information Overload**: Thousands of financial articles published daily
- **Time Constraints**: Markets require immediate response to breaking news
- **Consistency Issues**: Human analysis varies based on experience and bias
- **Scalability Limitations**: Manual analysis cannot scale with data volume
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple data sources require unified analysis

### 1.3 Proposed Solution

This paper introduces the Financial News Analysis Agent (FNAA), a multi-agent AI system that addresses these challenges through:
- Automated real-time news processing and analysis
- Specialized agents for different analysis dimensions
- Consistent, repeatable analytical processes
- Scalable architecture supporting high-volume processing
- Integrated decision support with confidence scoring

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Multi-Agent Framework

The FNAA employs a specialized multi-agent architecture based on LangGraph, featuring five distinct agents:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Preprocessing   │───▶│ Sentiment        │───▶│ Market Impact   │
│ Agent           │    │ Analysis Agent   │    │ Agent           │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                         │
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐             │
│ Aggregator      │◀───│ Entity Risk      │◀────────────┘
│ Agent           │    │ Agent            │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Core Components

- Context-aware sentiment evaluation
- Confidence scoring for sentiment predictions

**Technical Implementation:**
- Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model integration
- Specialized financial sentiment prompting
- Response validation and normalization

#### 2.2.3 Market Impact Agent
**Functionality:**

- Event significance evaluation
- Cross-reference with historical impact patterns

**Technical Implementation:**
- Context-aware prompting with ticker and sentiment information
- Impact classification based on financial event categories
- Validation against established impact indicators

#### 2.2.4 Entity Risk Agent
**Functionality:**

- Reputation: Brand damage, public relations issues
- Cyber: Technology risks, security breaches

#### 2.2.5 Aggregator Agent
**Functionality:**
- Multi-dimensional analysis synthesis
- Investment decision generation
- Confidence scoring and quality assessment

**Decision Logic:**
```python
if sentiment == "positive":
    if impact_level == "high" and not significant_risks:
        return "Strong Buy Signal"
    elif impact_level == "medium" and not significant_risks:
        return "Moderate Buy Signal"
    else:
        return "Weak Buy Signal"
```

### 2.3 State Management

The system utilizes a Pydantic-based state schema for type-safe data flow:

```python
class NewsState(BaseModel):
    news: Dict[str, Any]
    cleaned_content: str = ""
    tickers: List[str] = []
    sentiment: str = ""
    market_impact: str = ""
    risks: List[str] = []
    final_analysis: Dict[str, Any] = {}
```
